### Nice to meet you, I'm Michal ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my profile! 

I graduated from Biomedical and Electrical Engineering at McMaster University in 2020. Since then, I've developed a deep passion for 
AI/ML and data science, and I've been concentrating on learning as much as I can about this exciting and extensive space. I'm particularly interested in
leveraging the power of AI for social good in a variety of fields, including healthcare, environmental sciences, and public policy. Feel free to reach out if
you share any of these interests and would like to collaborate on a project, competition, or start-up! 

Also, connect with me if you'd like to share book suggestions (science fiction, Japanese classics, detective/mystery), discuss movies (Tarkovsky, Kubrick, Kon), chat about
music (listening and performing), and exchange fitness tips (bodybuilding, powerlifting) ðŸ˜Š

What I'm currently working on:

Implementing semantic segmentation for colonoscopies, completing my first Kaggle competition, learning about software engineering best practices... ðŸ’­
